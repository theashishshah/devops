# When I run a server, how does the server decides to run on localhost, why it doesn't provide a way to access apart from localhost

# when I a node.js server, I just mention a port not the domain name, so it runs on localhost and how can I make my server to be accessible from outsite of the world without deploying on any cloud based machine.
- basically How can i make my machine a server that runs 24x7 hours.
