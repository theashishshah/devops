Almost everything in linux is a file? 


1. How do you read a file? Let's say when you plug a pendrive, how the internal works? How are you able to modify or edit the data of a pendrive? can we design a readonly pendrive? 
2. when you insert a printer, how does it communicate and why are you as a user able to give it a instruction to print a file or make it run?
3. what is binary file ? or binary? how they run or what's the purpose of these?
